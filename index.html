        Sustainability can mean a great number of things. On this website, we'll
        stick with the definition that defines it as the avoidance of the
        depletion of natural resources in order to maintain an ecological
        balance. But sustainability can mean a lot more!

        <!-- TODO: Update the text with your own -->
        The impact we have on wildlife is horrifyingly severe. Not to mention
        deforestation, at least 800 species worldwide are affected by marine
        debris, and as much as 80 percent of that litter is plastic. Up to 13
        million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year—the
        equivalent of a rubbish or garbage truck load’s worth every minute.
        Fish, seabirds, sea turtles, and marine mammals can become entangled in
        or ingest plastic debris, causing suffocation, starvation, or drowning.
        It’s little wonder that it’s predicted there will be a higher volume of
        plastic in the oceans than fish by 2050. Is this enough for change for
        you?

        Every day, we pollute the world with our waste. Maybe you litter, drive,
        or buy clothing from a company that cares more for profits than for the
        environment. This adds up. Every year, one trillion gallons of untreated
        sewage and industrial waste is dumped in US water, 14 billion pounds of
        our garbage are dumped into the ocean, and more than one million
        seabirds and 100 million mammals die from our pollution. It has become
        an annual tradition for the Mississippi River to dump 1.5 million metric
        tons of nitrogen pollution in the Gulf of Mexico. When will enough be
        enough?

        To combat the heavy burden humanity has placed on the world, you can
        make some changes to your lifestyle. Although more on baby steps you can
        take is covered in our Take Action page, we will cover Zero Waste
        lifestyles here. A Zero Waste lifestyle is one of the most sustainable
        ways of living. The choices of this kind of lifestyle are influenced by
        all environmental areas including the prevention of resource extraction,
        the reduction of the materials sent to landfills or incinerators, and
        the reduction of pollution that is a result of production,
        transportation, or the disposal of materials. This is a incredibly
        environment-friendly way of living, but don't feel intimidated! Check
        out our Take Action page for smaller changes that will still make a
        world of difference. Because enough is enough.
