            There are many changes you can make to how you live your life to
            take a stand against the destruction of our world. Start with the
            little things you purchase for your diet, everyday supplies, and
            clothing! For instance, switch from cow's milk, which the production
            of causes a lot of greenhouse gas emissions, water degradation, and
            loss of natural habitats, to nondairy milks like soy or oat. Support
            your local farmers' markets and small businesses instead of big
            corporations and brands that not only treat their workers terribly,
            but also contribute to an unbelievable amount of carbon emissions,
            require a lot of water for manufacturing, and pollute our oceans
            with microplastics. Overall, simply shop considerably; think twice
            before making a purchase and keep asking yourself questions like:
          </p>
          <div class="p2">
            <li>"Do I really need this?"</li>
            <li>
              "Are there any alternatives I could find of this plastic-wrapped
              product?"
            </li>
            <li>
              "Do I stand by the values of the company that I am purchasing
              from?"
            </li>
            <li>"Could I get this product secondhand?" etc.</li>
